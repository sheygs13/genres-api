## JWT

When the user logs in, a JWT is generated by the server and sent back to the client
The user uses the JWT (which is likened to a passport/ID) to re-login

The JWT is ususally stored in the client-side like local-storage

> 401 (Unauthorized)

- User wants to access a protected resource but supplies an invalid jwt.

> 403 (Forbidden)

- Here, the user supplies a valid jwt but is not given the access due to the fact that the user is not an Admin
